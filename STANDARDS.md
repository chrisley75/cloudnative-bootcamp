    - Define Object in K8s
    - Describe one use case for Pods
    - Describe K8s including things like etcd and the control plane
    - Use the command line to debug an application using `get`, `describe`, `logs`, etc.

  - OpenShift
    - Explain the relationship between OpenShift and Kubernetes
    - Login to oc locally using the UI to get the token
    - Use `icc` to login to `oc` locally
    - Describe projects and how they relate to kubernetes
  - Tekton
    - Write a `Task` and run it via a `TaskRun`
    - Define `Task`, `TaskRun`, `Pipeline`, and `PipelineRun`
    - Use the Task Catalog to run `Tasks`
    - Use the Task Catalog to build a `Pipeline` that clones a Git repository and uses a Catalog Task on the cloned repository
      - Use the Task Catalog to build a `Pipeline` that clones a Git repository, runs the tests, builds the production version, creates a Docker image, pushes the image to quay.io and uses Kustomize to configure Kubernetes
    - Use the Task Catalog to build a `Pipeline` that clones a Git repository, runs the tests, builds the production version, creates a Docker image, pushes the image to quay.io and deploys the application
    - Create a `Pipeline` that clones a Git repository, runs the tests, builds the production version, creates a Docker image, pushes the image to quay.io and deploys the application, that is triggered by a Git push to the repository
  - Kustomize
    - Use `kustomize build` to create a `manifests.yaml`
  - CI
    - Explain the relationship between OpenShift and Tekton
    - Write a sequence diagram of CI
    - Build a Tekton pipeline incrementally using tasks from the Tekton Catalog

    - Given a wireframe containing many features provide a value-driven, prioritized backlog
    - Given a description of a client's approach to Agile, create a recommendation that is aligned with the Garage Method
    - Given information about a team's project tracker, explain what is happening and how the team fixes it via the Garage Method

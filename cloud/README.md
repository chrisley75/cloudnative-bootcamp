# Cloud Native Application Development

## Standards

- Explain Application Modernization
- Explain how Docker fits into Application Modernization and microservices

## Lesson

We will review this [IBM Garage Presentation](https://cloudnative101.dev/slides/01-What-Is-Cloud-Native.pdf) which provides a high level overview of application modernization.

When comparing modern, cloud-based application to more traditional deployment paradigms, there are key takeaways:

- Cloud-based applications rely on 12-factor application principles to drive portability across environments, pairity of development and production, and horizontal scalability.
- Concepts that are required for data center deployment, like physical resource availability, are largely abstracted.
- Deployment is a non-event and happens with high frequency. This is enabled by automated processes such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
- While the technology changes are difficult, the cultural change is harder. This requires time/effort/training and a ruthless focus on incremental value delivery.

The final point above, a _ruthless focus on incremental value delivery_ is the inspiration for this course. Modernizing applications is a problem like any other; it requires breaking down the larger issues into smaller, more easily solved problems. The approach of CI/CD from first principles is meant to spark creative approaches on how to get clients incremental success with their Devops transformation efforts.

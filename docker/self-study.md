# Self Study â€“ Docker

## Cloud Engineer (Developer AND Operations)

Finish any part of today's assignments that you were unable to finish during class. Make sure to commit any new work you have completed to the `assignments` repository.

## Cloud Engineer (Developer)

1. In a language/framework combination that you are familiar with, create a new application and use the documentation to write a `Dockerfile` to containerize your newly generated application. It is OK to start with a development command like we did today, but ideally you should be able to advance through a "production optimized" build.
2. Is there a way for you to use Docker as part of your development workflow? Research if it is possible to use Docker in your preferred stack and toolchain (IDE, etc.). Then, try to develop a simple application using Docker. Does it slow down development? Does it speed up development?

## Cloud Engineer (Operations)

Choose 2 language/framework combinations that were not covered in class today. Use Google to find a few different ways that people online have created `Dockerfile`s for that given language/framework combination. Attempt to synthesize across multiple options and produce a single `Dockerfile` for each language/framework combination. Use `docker build` and `docker run` to confirm that you correctly containerized the application. You may need to find blog posts for each language/framework you choose to determine the correct commands to build and serve the application.

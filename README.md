# IBM Cloud Garage - CI/CD from First Principles

## Purpose

**Objective** Build a CI/CD pipeline in the IBM Cloud from first principles.

The course standards can be found [here](./STANDARDS.md) and course schedule can be found [here APAC](./SCHEDULE-APAC.md) and [here for EMEA](./SCHEDULE-EMEA.md) .

## Instructional Techniques

- **From First Principles** - Applying the concept of [Self Similarity]() from Extreme Programming (XP) we will start at the documentation as much as is possible.
- **Slack Threads** - We will rely on a "same time response" pattern for Slack Threads to maximize participation and student cognitive load.
- **Cold Calling** - At times your instructor will call on you and ask a question or ask for clarification on something. Our goal is to measure how the class is advancing rather than to take any type of punitive action.
- **Content Cycles** - Our content cycles will typically be in either:
  - "I do / We do / You do" - I will demonstrate a technique, we will apply that technique as a group with you all guiding me, and then you will do it yourself.
  - "I do / You do in Pairs"

We will keep the ratio of student cognitive load high and ["sage on the stage"](https://tophat.com/glossary/s/sage-on-the-stage/) time as low as possible.

## Your Commitment Level

You will need to be 100% focused for the duration of the four hours or will struggle to keep up. We have limited time, so we will leverage instructional design techniques to keep it interactive.

## Structure

- Three (3) seventy-minute (70) sessions with two (2), fifteen-minute (15) breaks in between. This is similar to:
  - a game of hockey with three 70-minute periods and two 15-minute intermissions.
  - a play with three acts of equal, 70-minute, length, with two 15-minute intermissions.
  - a structure that conforms to `3X + 2Y = 240` where `X` is content section and `Y` is break. _Are there any other solutions with positive X and Y?_

# Client Scenarios

## Standards

- Given a description of a client's approach to Agile, create a recommendation that is aligned with the Garage Method

## Lesson

In this lesson, as a Squad, you will analyze two (2) client scenarios. In both instances, the client is struggling with their approach to Agile.

**Your goal** is to provide the client with a set of recommendations on how to improve their company to better align with the Garage Method, in an incremental way. In other words, what are the next 1-2 things this company should do to move closer to the Garage Method?

You should spend a little less than `15` minutes per scenario, with one Squad member acting as a Scribe (sharing their screen) with the final recommendation. You may use any format you want to make this recommendation.

### Scenario 1

Your client states, "we have adopted agile here. We are so Agile that we can probably teach you something. In fact, IBM Garage is probably not needed here at all. We will send _you_ a bill for consulting."

When challenged with "how does an idea get to production?" the client says:

> Well, it's rather simple. We take any idea and send it to the idea review board in the Finance Department who decides if the idea is a good idea or bad idea. The good ideas are then passed to the next phase, which is exploration. In this phase, finance works with the idea creator to see if it is possible or not to make money from this project. The technology focused projects are often too hard to understand how to be profitable from, so they mostly stop at this stage. Any idea that advances from the finance/creator phase is eventually assigned to a delivery team who takes this to production.

When asked "well what is the overall cycle time on this?" the client says:

> Infrastructure is a week of provisioning but after that the developers get to move quickly. We deploy all of their stories once a week, after the acceptance meeting. Once a quarter we have a code freeze to make sure that systems are stable.

### Scenario 2

Your client is distraught. They come to the meeting with IBM Garage saying that they cannot find anyone to hire. Moreover, the developers they do have, are quitting slowly. The client sees developer headcount decreasing but has no idea what to do.

When asked about the production environment, the client says:

> It performs incredibly well, and our customers absolutely love the snappy experience they get. It crashes 3-5 times a week, in a good week, but we have such a good team of engineers that they always take care of the problem quickly. In fact, our team of engineers is probably one of the best out there. Whenever there is an issue, they are quick to respond. Honestly, they feel more like heroes than engineers sometimes.

After being challenged on the response to the product environment with, "well what do you think causes the crashes?", the client says:

> I think it's the hardware, or something. Honestly, I don't know. The engineers are just so... engineer-like that my eyes glaze over half of the time they talk. All I know is, it crashes, but they fix it every time.

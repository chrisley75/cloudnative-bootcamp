# Stories Activity

## Standards

- Write a story given a wireframe

## Lesson

Your instructor will assign you a squad.

As a squad you will use [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bnufsGGRHgVna0aKaaWNUHIrWR0QI79MinxxBccIBqM/edit#slide=id.gb37777a647_0_190) of wireframes to practicing story writing.

Your goal is that by the end of 30 minutes, your Squad has well-written stories for the first three (3) wireframes.

The easiest way to do this is for someone to volunteer to be the Scribe who shares their screen and writes down the stories. You may use whatever tool is most convenient, even a simple text editor will work.

At the end of 30 minutes you will rejoin the Main Room where your instructor will finish the activity with a Story Review of all the Squad's stories.

# Self Study â€“ Kustomize, Triggers

## Cloud Engineer (Developer AND Operations)

1. Finish any part of today's assignments that you were unable to finish during class. Make sure to commit any new work you have completed to the `assignments` repository.
1. For the application you created yesterday implement the remaining portions of the CI pipeline (buildah, Kustomize, and Build Triggers). **How do I know I am done?** You are done when a `git push` to your application's repository triggers a run of your CI pipeline which leads to a deployment to the cluster via `kubectl apply`. If you have completed all of these steps please create a folder called `<your-name>/self-study` in the `assignments` repository (if you have already established a `self-study` folder, then continue with your existing convention). In this folder copy all of your YAML and make a commit and push.

# Introductions

## Objective

- Learn something about each member of the class

## Activity

This course is short, so we will keep introductions to answering the following questions, with the instructor calling on each person to say their answers.

- What is your name?
- What is your role at IBM?
- How long have you been at IBM?
- What is something that most people would not know about you?

For example, "My name is Tim. I'm a Cloud Engineer in the IBM Garage in Australia. I've worked at IBM for about 10 years now, wow it's been so long. Most people would not know that I run marathons in my spare time."
